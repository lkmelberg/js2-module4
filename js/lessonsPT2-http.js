// http request methods

// An example of a GET request would be fetching a list of articles from a server.

// An example of a POST request would be where we send data to a server, and a new item gets created, such as a new user.

// An example of a PATCH request is if we had a user with information
//  and we wanted to update their information, such as updating their e - mail address.

// An example of a PUT request would be where we want to replace one product with another.

// An example of a DELETE request would be where we would delete an entire item, such as deleting an article or a user.

// An example of using the HEAD request would be where youâ€™d want to get meta-information about a server without needing response body.

// An example of the CONNECT request is when you want to access websites that use SSL.

// An example of the OPTIONS method is checking what methods a server would allow.

// An example of a TRACE method is where you would want to test the server is responding.

// Safe and non-safe methods

// Safe methods never modify resources or change the state of a server. An example of a safe method is GET, as it only obtains data.

// The POST method is a non-safe method as it may change the state of the server by creating a new entry/record.
// Idempotent methods

// Idempotent methods can be made once or several times in a row with the same effect while
//  leaving the server in the same state.Examples of these are GET, HEAD, PUT and DELETE.
